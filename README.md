# RPG-Maker-MV-Plugins
My RPG Maker MV plugins. Plugins add additional functionality to the game engine.

### *Usage conditions for commercial projects:* Free to use and include if credit is given in-game to the author.
*Games that use the Yanfly Engine must also follow these terms of use: http://yanfly.moe/terms-of-use/*


# Current Plugins
## DisableTAB
Changes TAB key behavior for compatibility with Zalerinian's Gamefocus plugin (http://mvplugins.com/plugin/Zalerinian/GameFocus)

*Not enabling this plugin would cause the Gamefocus plugin to freeze the game if the TAB key is pressed alone. Alt+TAB still works after activating the DisableTAB plugin.*


## CustomGoToTile
Changes the default "Go to Title" window to one with transparency and larger width. This allows for menu consistency in games where the in-game menu is transparent.

## YEP_AFPVS_QuitGame
Adds the Quit Game option to the title screen in games that use the Yanfly Engine.

 *This plugin allows you to place a "Quit Game" option at the title screen's command window towards the bottom.*
 *Based on Yanfly code.*
 *Yanfly Core Engine plugin must be activated on the engine (http://yanfly.moe/yep/)*
